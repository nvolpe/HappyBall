# HappyBall
webapp for gambling between me and my friends on fantasy football :)

Hugely overbuilt and lots of time wasted just to manage friendly bets between 12 of my friends. 

## Frontend
Written with Backbone-Marionette, and several fun open source JS libraries. I even used leaflet maps and the HTML Geolocation API so we could see our friends on a map across the country. Yes I'm a huge nerd.

## Backend
Sever side built with ASP.NET and Microsoft SQL Server. I was able to build a functional system to manage user's bets and geolocation.. I am also very proud of the automation I built in to calculate the standings for our league instead of calculating the winnings by hand each week.
